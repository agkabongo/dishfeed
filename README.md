## ⚡DishFeed App 
How many times have you found yourself looking for that perfect recipe – only to find that you’re missing one or more ingredients?

How many times have you opened the fridge and thought to yourself -- what can I make ?

How many times have you thrown away an ingredient, because you couldn't figure out how to use it before it expired ?

The DishFeed App allows you to search for yummy recipes . All the recipes you see on DishFeed are recipes you can make right now. No more inconvenient grocery runs.

This application was developed to provide examples of how to use React.
